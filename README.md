# Blackjack

This is my version of the famous card game "Blackjack"! This project taught me a lot about planning and the process of creating a product. This is because I had to test every little piece of the game to ensure that everything works as expected.

Some features of this project include:

1) Has a database that stores information about all players that have ever played the game.
2) Has a leaderboard that ranks all the players and displays the top 5 players who have the higest score.
3) Allows the user to use the mouse and keyboard to navigate around the game.
4) The project was coded in Python and was created using Processing. To view the full code and simulate the game yourself:
